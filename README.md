# Data-Visualisation-with-Polynomial-Regression---Matlab
This is the repo of my project called Data Visualisation using Regression method. The project was intended to find the best line for given datasets using polynomial regression. After finding the best line, it is plotted on a chart to see it's fitting. If it overfits, the polynomial degree is reduced.

This sub project is conducted on Matlab. The task pdf describs the task requirements. You can simply run these matlab files one by one to see the generated graphs and predictions. For this, please make sure that you have all the data files in a known directory.
